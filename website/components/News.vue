      <strong>04/02/2021:</strong> <strong>Kroger</strong> and all of its brands
      (<strong>Harris Teeter</strong>, etc.) are now being scanned nation-wide.
      ðŸ’« If Kroger keeps letting me scan their site, I'm next going to try and
      detect 2nd dose booking issues I know some users run into on their site.
      Also, <strong>PrepMod</strong> locations are now being scanned for
      Colorado users. Good luck everyone! Any feedback is welcome:

      coder and have interest in helping out on
      <a href="https://github.com/GUI/covid-vaccine-finder/issues">GitHub</a>,
      that would be dandy (although the code's still messy)!
