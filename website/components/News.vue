      <strong>04/18/2021:</strong> More locations! ðŸ’–
      <strong>Publix</strong> pharmacies are now being scanned in FL, GA, SC,
      and VA. Publix locations in AL, NC, and TN should also start being scanned
      tomorrow when scheduling opens up in those states. Hope that helps! Any
      feedback is welcome:

      coder and have interest in helping out on
      <a href="https://github.com/GUI/covid-vaccine-finder/issues">GitHub</a>,
      that would be dandy (although the code's still messy)!
